In 1990 your sons, daughters, grandsons, and grandchildren will be applying to the colleges
of this state in a number 3 times what they do today. Our airports will serve 5 times as many
passenger miles. We will need housing for a hundred million more people, and many times more
doctors and engineers and technicians than we are presently producing. That is why we're trying
to do more in these areas. As in the thirties, Albert Thomas and Franklin Roosevelt and others
did those things which make it possible for not only Texas, but the entire United States to 
prosper and grow as we do in the 1960's. In 1990, the age of space will be entering it's second
phase, and our hope's in it to preserve the peace, to make sure that in this great new sea, as on
Earth, the United States is second to none.
